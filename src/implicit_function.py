        Optionally, `source_range` is a `(v,d)` array of vectors defining a general box in space over which to evaluate the query. These vectors must be orthogonal to `bound_vec`. The result is then a minimum over all direction vectors in that prisim. 

        Many methods incidentally compute the value of the function at the source as a part of evaluating this routine. If `return_source_value=True` the return will be a tuple `value, distance` giving the value as well.
